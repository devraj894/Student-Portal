## Project Overview
This is a **responsive dashboard** built with **Next.js** that includes various components such as a **navbar**, **announcement section**, **class schedules**, **quick links**, and **modals**. The UI is optimized for both **desktop and mobile** users, ensuring a seamless experience.


## Features

- Interactive modal for user actions.
- Optimized for performance with Next.js server-side rendering.
- Clean and intuitive UI with a focus on user experience.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
